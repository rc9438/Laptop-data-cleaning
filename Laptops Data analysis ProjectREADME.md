# Laptops Data Analysis Project (SQL)

This project is an analysis of laptops data using SQL. The data used in this project is from Kaggle's Laptops Dataset, which includes information about various laptops such as brand, model, price, specifications, and more.

The main objective of this project is to explore the data and gain insights that can be useful for potential laptop buyers, sellers, or manufacturers. The analysis is performed using SQL queries to extract relevant information from the dataset.

# Requirements

To run the SQL queries in this project, you need to have access to a database management system that supports SQL. You can use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other DBMS of your choice.

# Data
The Laptops Dataset used in this project consists of one CSV file named laptops.csv. The file contains information about 1,309 laptops, including brand, model name, display size, processor type, graphics card, storage, RAM, weight, price, and more.

# Analysis
The analysis of the Laptops Dataset is performed using SQL queries. The queries are organized into different categories based on the type of analysis. The categories are as follows:

Data Exploration: basic exploration of the dataset, such as finding the number of rows and columns, identifying missing values, and more.
Data Cleaning: cleaning the dataset by removing or replacing missing values, correcting data types, and more.
Data Aggregation: aggregating the data by brand, price range, and other attributes to gain insights into the dataset.
Data Visualization: visualizing the data using various charts and graphs to understand the patterns and relationships in the dataset.

# Findings
The analysis of the Laptops Dataset using SQL queries revealed several interesting findings, including:

The most popular laptop brands are Lenovo, Dell, and HP, which account for over 50% of the total laptops in the dataset.
The average price of laptops in the dataset is ₹85,828.16, with a standard deviation of ₹63,789.63, indicating a wide range of prices.
Laptops with Intel processors are more expensive than those with AMD processors on average, with a price difference of around ₹23,025.33.
The top three laptop brands with the highest average price are Apple, Razer, and Microsoft, with average prices of ₹176,689.89, ₹126,031.14, and ₹119,124.45, respectively.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis of the Laptops Dataset using SQL queries provided several insights into the dataset that can be useful for potential laptop buyers, sellers, or manufacturers. By analyzing the dataset, we were able to identify the most popular brands, the average price of laptops, and the price differences between different types of processors and brands. The findings can be used to inform purchasing decisions, marketing strategies, and product development.
