# Laptops Data Analysis Project (SQL)
This project is an analysis of laptops data using SQL. It aims to explore the dataset and uncover insights that could be helpful in making data-driven decisions.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have a working installation of SQL. You can use any SQL client, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

I# nstalling
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open your SQL client and create a new database.
Import the data from the laptops.csv file into the database.
Open the SQL scripts in your client and run them to execute the queries.
# Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

laptops.csv: The raw data file containing information about laptops, such as brand, model, price, and specifications.
queries.sql: The main SQL script that contains the queries used to analyze the data.
results.csv: The output file containing the results of the queries.
Usage
The queries in the scripts are designed to answer questions about the dataset, such as:

What is the average price of laptops by brand?
Which laptop has the highest screen resolution?
What is the distribution of laptop prices by brand?
You can run the queries in any SQL client and export the results to a file for further analysis.
